# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyser
Analyses group whatsapp chats
This application provides analysis of  data from exported WhatsApp chats. The key advantage of this system is that it is implemented using simple python libraries like seaborn, streamlit, numpy, matplotlib and pandas. These are commonly used for creating data frames and graphs.
It tracks our conversation and analyses how much time we are spending or saying it as “wasting” on WhatsApp
